## What is Cerberus

We are building a open source platform for mentorships.

We believe in the power of mentors - having mentors but also being mentors.

We searched around and didn't find any free or open source solution that would fit this bill in a nice, clean and easy to use manner, so we decided to build one.

We invite you to join and leave your contribution as well.
